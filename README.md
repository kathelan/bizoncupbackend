# ARDF-FJWw Integration and Results Visualization Web Application
 The ARDF-FJWw Integration and Results Visualization Web Application is designed to integrate with the ARDF-FJWw application, which is used to track and manage Amateur Radio Direction Finding (ARDF) competitions. This web application provides a seamless way to receive ARDF competition results data from the ARDF-FJWw application and present it in an easily accessible and visually appealing format on a web platform.

This project is primarily used for a specific competition series called the BIZON CUP 2023.

# Key Features
Integration with ARDF-FJWw application: The web application is capable of receiving ARDF competition results data in JSON format from the ARDF-FJWw application via an API endpoint. This ensures smooth data transfer between the two systems.

# Data processing and storage: 
The received data is processed, validated, and stored in the web application's memory, allowing for quick access and retrieval of the competition results.

# Results visualization: 
The web application provides a user-friendly interface to view and interact with the ARDF competition results. Users can easily browse through the results and gain insights into the performance of individual competitors and overall competition trends.

# Data retrieval API: 
The web application exposes a RESTful API endpoint that allows other systems or applications to fetch the stored ARDF competition results, enabling seamless integration with external platforms for further analysis or visualization.

# Scalability and extensibility: 
The web application is built using modern development practices and technologies, such as Java 17 and Spring Boot, ensuring that it is scalable and extensible to accommodate future enhancements and requirements.
